### CPAD2023SecBTeam04

We have created a News App using React Native Technology and also learnt the technology step by step. The first version of the app had its own backend and was rendered using the pics and data stored in the backend. Later we enhanced the app making it dynamic via using Public API to fetch data, images and search results.


Improvements suggested and implemented :
1. Caching: This improves performance by storing the search results in local cache using Memoize functionality and reducing the number of API calls required to render.

2. Live Search Feature based on Keywords. This is using a call to a public API which fetches the current results based on keywords.



# Application: News App
